# OpenFlap

**ðŸš¨ This is still a work in progress. Using the the code and files in this repository to create your own display is not recommended at the moment! ðŸš¨**

The OpenFlap project aims to create a open source, affordable split-flap display for the makers and tinkerers of the world.
This repository houses all the required files to build, program and modify your very own split-flap display. 

![OpenFlap Module][module_gif] 

## Specifications

- 48 Flaps per module.
- Simple wiring.
- Daisy chain communication.
- Per module configuration & calibration.
- No homing sequence.
- HTTP API available.
- Customizable.
- Stackable design.

## Design Requirements

#### The split-flap display should be affordable but high quality. 
I would rather sink in more time than money.

#### The split-flap display shall not require a homing sequence. 
To achieve this, the OpenFlap modules contain an optical absolute encoder. This encoder allows the module to know i'ts position at any time.

#### The design shall consist only of printed circuit boards and 3D printable parts. 

#### The amount of wiring to connect multiple modules should be minimal.
The modules and top connector boards feature a smart switching mechanism that automatically routes the UART data signal.

![OpenFlap Signalpath][uart_signalpath]

Each module and top connector board contains an input that when pulled low, interrupts the default data return path and continues the data path to the next module instead. This is shown in the image above in red (interrupted signal path) and green (non interrupted signal path). 

#### The split-flap display shall only requires calibration once.
Each module contains a micro controller capable of storing calibration values.

#### The split-flap display shall be able to determine it's own size and dimensions.
Each module can sense if it is there is another module connected below itself. The controller can query this information and calculate the width and height of the display based on this information. This currently does constrain the system to only support rectangular displays. 

#### The split-flap display must be controllable through a local webpage.

## Architecture

The OpenFlap system consists of 3 main components:

1) [OpenFlap Module](#openflap-module)
2) [OpenFlap Controller](#openflap-controller)
3) [OpenFlap Top-Connector](#openflap-top-connector)

The OpenFlap modules are designed to be stackable. Each stack of modules must be topped of with top-connector board, these top-connector boards can be connected together to chain together multiple stacks of modules. A controller board can be connected to the first (left-most) top-connector board, it will serve as the brain for the OpenFlap display.

### OpenFlap Module
![OpenFlap Module][module]

The modules consist of multiple 3D printed parts, sandwiched between two PCB's. Only one of those PCB's should be populated with components. 

All required production files are available in [/hardware/side_panel](/hardware/side_panel), [/hardware/flaps](/hardware/flaps) and [/hardware/encoder_wheel](/hardware/encoder_wheel).

To make one module, you will need:
- 48 flaps
- 1 populated side panel
- 1 unpopulated side panel
- 2 encoder wheels 
- 32x [M2.6x8mm screw](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005003094076706.html)
- 1x [12V 60RPM MicroMotor](https://aliexpress.com/item/33022320164.html)
- 1x [3mm motor shaft coupler](https://aliexpress.com/item/4000342135388.html)

Additional PCB order info:
- flaps : 49mm x 35mm, **0.8mm board thickness**, Remove Order Number!
- encoder wheel: 74mm x 74mm, **Aluminum base material**, Remove Order Number!

3D print these parts, this should be possible without supports:
- [The shell](/3d/module_shell.stl)
- [The core](/3d/module_core.stl) OR [The core for use with bearings](/3d/module_core_for_bearings.stl)
- [The long hub](/3d/module_hub_long.stl)
- [The short hub](/3d/module_hub_short.stl)

#### Assembly Instructions:

1) Assemble the *flaps* and the *core* in between the two *encoder wheels*. The printed side of the encode wheels must face outside. Make sure the orientation of the flaps in regard to the core is correct. The motor should be able to fit in the left side when the letters are facing you. A [3D printable tool](/3d/flap_setter_tool.stl) is provided in this repository to aid with the assembly of the flap wheels.

![Flap Assembler][flap_assembler]

2) Slide the motor through the *long hub* and attach the shaft coupler.

3) Solder the motor onto the populated side of the *side panel* in such away that the '+' symbol on the motor matches the '+' symbol on the backside of the PCB. Apply solder to the solder bridges marked with the white stripes. If the motor where to turn with an incorrect direction, the solder bridges can be swapped to reverse the motor polarity. Use 4 screws to attach the *long hub* to the side panel.

4) Use 4 screws to attach the *short hub* to the unpopulated side panel.

5) Insert the *core* into the *shell* and sandwich in between the two *side panels*.

### OpenFlap Controller
![OpenFlap Controller][controller]

The controller hosts a webpage through which the display can be used. The webpage should be accessible through http://openflap.local/. The controller provides an access point on SSID: `OpenFlap` with a default password: `myOpenFlap`. Through the webpage, the controller can be configured to join your local network. (Reboot required)

All required production files are available in [/hardware/controller](/hardware/controller). You might want to solder on [horizontal SMD header pins](https://aliexpress.com/item/32795058236.html) in order to connect your serial cable for programming. 

### OpenFlap Top Connector
![OpenFlap Top-Con][top_con]

You will need 1 _Top Connector_ and 1 idc cable for each column in your display. The _Top Connector_ provides power to the column of displays. in this way the displays don't all require their own power circuitry. The board also helps to rout the data through the modules and back to the controller.

All required production files are available in [/hardware/top_con](/hardware/top_con). Additionally you will need to add the following components manually:

- [2x8 pin 2.54mm, low-profile, bottom-entry Header Socket](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005003263426999.html)
- 2x [2x8 pin box header](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005001400147026.html)
- 2x [2x8 pin idc Female Connector](https://aliexpress.com/item/4001257530318.html)
- 6.5cm / 2.5" [16 strand flatcable](https://aliexpress.com/item/32998004363.html)
- 2x [M2.6x8mm screw](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005003094076706.html)

The notch of the connectors on the cable should point in the same direction. Either both left or both right. The cable length should be around 6.5cm or 2.5".

## Development Environment 

A VS Code devcontainer is provided in this repository.

To flash the *controller* form inside the devcontainer you will need to forward your serial cable, see the [README.md](/.devcontainer/hardware/README.md).

I was unable to work with the PICkit 4 from inside the devcontainer. You can compile the hex files and flash the from your host machine using MPLABX IPE.

## Controller HTTP API

Endpoints:

- /api/modules
- /api/wifi
- /firmware

### modules
A http GET request on the `/api/modules` endpoint returns a JSON array containing all module properties. 

```
[
    {
        "module":	0,
        "columnEnd":	true,
        "characterMapSize":	48,
        "characterMap":	[" ", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z", "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "â‚¬", "$", "!", "?", ".", ",", ":", "/", "@", "#", "&"],
        "offset":	0,
        "vtrim":	0,
        "character":	"L"
    },{
        ...
    }
]
```

Try it with curl: `curl -X GET http://openflap.local/api/modules`

To write data to the modules, a http POST request can be used. The body of the request should be formatted in the same way as the response from a GET request. You only need to add `module` index and the properties which you want to update.

Try it with curl: `curl -X POST http://openflap.local/api/modules -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '[{"module":0,"character":"O"}]'`

### wifi

To change the used wifi credentials, a http POST request must be made to the `/api/wifi` endpoint.

Use these credentials for the hosted access point.
```
{
"host":{
        "ssid": "my_ssid",
        "password": "my_password",
    }
}
```
Use these credentials to connect to an existing an access point.
```
{
"join":{
        "ssid": "my_ssid",
        "password": "my_password",
    }
}
```

A reboot is requeued for these changes to take effect.
