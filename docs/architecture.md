# Architecture

The OpenFlap system can be divided into 3 main components:

- The **OpenFlap Controller**.
- The **OpenFlap Module**.
- The **OpenFlap Top Connector**.

To build an OpenFlap display, you need at least one OpenFlap Controller, A Top Connector for each column of modules and one or more OpenFlap Modules.
