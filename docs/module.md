# OpenFlap Module

The OpenFlap module is the main attraction of the OpenFlap system. It consists of number of 3D prints and PCBs sandwiched together to create a display.

The construction of the module can be described as follows:
A 3D printed 'shell' is sandwiched between two side panel PCBs. A 3D printed bearing is mounted on each of the side panels and the 'flap wheel' is mounted on these bearings. The flap wheel consists of 3D printed core sandwiched between two PCBs. All the flaps rest between these two PCBs. 

Only the left side panel PCB is populated with components. The right side panel PCB is left unpopulated and is used to provide mechanical support. 


!!! note

    In theory, the unpopulated side panel PCB could be replaced with a 3D printed part, this 3D printed part could then also be fused with the 'shell' and on of the 'bearings' greatly simplifying the assembly process and reducing the part count. But it would make the design asymmetrical and I just won't have it...
